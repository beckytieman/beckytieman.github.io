                    alt="Magnolia Home Page"><br>
                The Magnolia Home page is a great example of utilizing white space to achieve a very clean design.
                The main image is simple with Joanna Gaines as the focus. The title/logo are placed neatly in the center
                box with a good amount of space to the border.
                The proximity of the Headers, Paragraph, and Navigation with a center alignment add to the clean appeal
                of the overall design.

            <h4>Disneyland</h4>
            <a href="https://disneyland.disney.go.com/">disneyland.com</a>
            
            <p><img id="Disney" src="images/DisneylandÂ® Official Site-page-001 (1).jpg" alt="Disney Home Page"><br>
                This home page for Disneyland makes it very clear that one of the most important things is to purchase tickets.  
                They utilized the rules of visual hierachy to convey to the user what is most imprortant to them. 
                In this case it's the image, the tickets button, logo, and subsiquent navigation links. There is more useful information as you continue
                 to scroll down in the mobile view, but they did a great job making the most important things stand out towards the top. </p>

                alt="Crumbl Home Page"><br>
                The Crumbl Cookies home page has so many uses of effective contrast.  It makes their page visually appealing and easy to read. 
                The simple black and white colors of the font and navigation buttons aid to readability and user experience. 
                They also used good font contrast by varying the weight of the typeface and choosing to put certain in all caps. 
                Lastly, all of their product images contrast very well with the clean white bakground. gicing the visitor a clear
                 understanding of what they have to offer, and showing it as the focal point. </p>
